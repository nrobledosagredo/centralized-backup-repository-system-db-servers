This project is a centralized backup repository system designed for managing database backups across different servers. It leverages technologies such as MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Docker, Flask, and React to provide a scalable and secure solution for database management. The system is divided into separate client and server components, each with its own frontend and backend, ensuring flexibility and easy integration. This project is part of a distributed systems learning project, aimed at understanding the concepts of networked applications, data synchronization, and service orchestration in a real-world context.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.9.x**
- **MariaDB v10.6.12** or **PostgreSQL v14.7**
- **Docker** (version 19.03 or higher)
- **Docker Compose** (version 3.8 or higher)
- **pip** (for installing Python dependencies)

---

## Generate test data

1. Run the following commands to install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install faker==18.6.2
pip install pymysql==1.0.3
pip install psycopg2==2.9.6
```

2. **MariaDB** database setup:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database;
CREATE USER 'your_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database.* TO 'your_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

3. **PostgreSQL** database setup:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database;
CREATE USER your_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_database TO your_user;
```

4. To generate test data, navigate to the `client_fake_data_generator` folder and run one of the following scripts, depending on your database:
```bash
python mariadb_fake_data_generator.py <config>
python postgresql_fake_data_generator.py <config>
```
Where `<config>` can be `db1_config.json`, `db2_config.json`, or `db3_config.json`.

## Configuration

### Client `.env` files

The project includes three predefined clients (users). To add a new client:

1. Create a new folder under `./client/` (e.g., `client4_app`).
2. Copy the files from an existing client (e.g., `client1_app`) into the new folder.
3. Configure the `.env` file with the specific values for the new client.

Example of a clientâ€™s `.env` file:
```env
CLIENT_USERNAME=client1
CLIENT_APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
CLIENT_APP_PORT=5001
CENTRAL_API_RECEIVE_BACKUP_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/receive_backup
DB_HOST=0.0.0.0
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=test_user
DB_PASSWORD=test_password
DB_NAME=db1
DB_TYPE=mysql
BACKUP_DAY=2
BACKUP_HOUR=18
BACKUP_MINUTE=45
```

To add the new client to the Docker service, add the following section to the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
  client4_app:
    build:
      context: ./client/client4_app
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    env_file:
      - ./client/client4_app/.env
    network_mode: host
    depends_on:
      - server_app
    volumes:
      - ./client/client4_app/keys:/app/keys
      - ./client/client4_app/logs:/app/logs
      - ./client/client4_app/files:/app/files
    environment:
      - TZ=America/Santiago
```

### Server configuration

The server `.env` file should have the following structure:
```env
SERVER_APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
SERVER_APP_PORT=5000
```

---

## Deployment

Before starting the deployment, ensure that the `.env` files are correctly configured at the following paths:
- `./server/server_app/.env`
- `./client/client1_app/.env`
- `./client/client2_app/.env`
- `./client/client3_app/.env`

### Build and run

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project, where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.
2. Run the service build:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```
3. Once the build is complete, start the application with:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   The services will now run in separate containers.

### Stop the application

To stop all services, run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Administrator frontend

Access the administrator frontend at:
```
http://IP:3000/
```
This interface provides administrators with full control to view, manage, and delete backups.

### User frontend

Access the user frontend at:
```
http://IP:PORT/
```
This interface allows users to securely view and decrypt their backups.
